# EngageInsight

## Overview

EngageInsight is a data visualization project focused on analyzing user interactions within a dataset of comments and replies. The project involves cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to remove duplicates and handle missing values. It then utilizes Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to create insightful visualizations. The visualizations provide an overview of comment lengths, the frequency of different types of replies, and trends over time. The goal is to gain valuable insights into user engagement and interaction patterns from the dataset.
